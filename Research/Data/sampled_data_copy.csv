I hated it at first as it was hard for me to cope with the change from an Iphone but after a month was in love with it. For me the battery will last about 4-5 days though it is mostly on stand by. Still, my Iphone on standby would drain in less than a day. It is feature packed and the processor is plenty fast for me. It is a bit bigger, which Im not a fan of but I expected that because of the battery being almost twice the capacit of the regular E4. I have had mine for over a year and everything still works perfect and have not noticed the battery wearing out yet, knock on wood. You can buy a replacement battery on ebay and ever get the tool for the tiny 5 point star pattern they have locking the battery in. It is a pain but totally doable.

I really like the way this phone looks and feels, however, if a phone can't make a call or go online with LTE... All 3 phones had a grueling 250mb software update out of the box. Tried with both AT&T and Cricket, and both had LTE disconnecting like clockwork. I've never seen this in a phone before... Let alone a SONY.

That said, I was surprised at how good this phone is. Here are the things I love about the phone compared to my older phone (newer phones might also do this): - Fantastic camera - Offline maps and offline navigation. I opted to not have a data plan at all, so this was essential. Even without data, I can use the maps to get anywhere. - The wireless charger is cool - The onenote app is awesome. I used evernote on the nexus and one time it deleted something I had written (it might have been an edge case). Anyway, I like the onenote app better and it integrates with how I take notes on my desktop machines. - Little things - I like how you can lock your screen, but configure how long it stays unlocked if you've used it recently. I like how you can press the button to take a picture even if the screen is locked (I'm sure other phones do this too, but my nexus didn't). When it's charging the little icon alternates between percentage and the charging icon (the nexus just had the charging icon). - I'm not an IE fan on the Desktop, but IE 10 on mobile is pretty slick. It might be my favorite mobile browser (on the nexus one I used the stock android browser,Firefox, and opera, but chrome wasn't available) It's a great phone, I recommend it!",Not Verified,Positive

B: The scanner works well, IF you give it the correct placement. It's guilty of being very sensitive. That's a good thing. C: The brightness can need adjusting in the daylight, that I will not argue. But it's manageable. The battery? Amazing. I've pushed this thing with graphic intensive apps, and by the end of the day, still had somewhere around 70% of the battery left. I mostly use for phone and text. But if you have apps that stay on in the background, like twitter or other social media energy vampires, expect it to go faster. And the camera is awesome. Going from a Acatel Idol 5 to this, it's like night an day. It's not going to wow Photography aficionados, but to the rest of us, this camera screams to be used. The three lenses (48 megapixel main, 5mp width and 2mp depth) help create a smooth and detailed shot. Warning: you better get yourself a really good screen protector if you're a serial klutz. This screen cracked with my BESTALICE case for the Mi A3, and when the protector cracked, it gave me a hairline crack to the actual screen.

I needed one that was a good phone send a few texts get onto the internet when I needed to and maybe take a picture now or then. This phone can also do those other things. But will it be as good as a 1,000.00 high end smart phone probably not. But if you are looking for an entry level unlocked smart phone for 189.00 it is probably one of the best. The way I use my phone it is very reliable and has fantastic battery life. And even better the only software on it when you get it is Android version 9. This is the first android phone that I have ever owned that I can truly say is easy to use. There is no bloatware and no one has screwed up the interface.

I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it. Pros: Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag. Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color. Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode. Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3. Display: Nothing to complain. Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool. SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet. Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it. Cons: Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case. Wish list: Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge. Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ"".",Verified,Neutral

More specifically the phone will ring but you cannot hear or be heard. Unfortunately I had moved to France (from NYC) in the meantime to study for a year in Paris. The phone is in perfect condition, it is also under warranty and I had also bought insurance from ProjectFi. After spending hours doing all the possible repair options (including factory reset), chatting with customer service and writing endless emails over a month, Google asked me for a shipping address. I thought Google would finally come through and ship me a replacement phone. Here is their last answer: "" A replacement cannot be provided for in a country where Google does not sell the same device. We gave it a try, but we will not be able to process a replacement while you are in France. The Pixel is not sold by Google in France, and so there is no way to send a replacement in that country. Only thing we can do is wait for your return to the U.S., or check if a family member or friend can go through the replacement process for you."" If you happen to move temporarily outside of the 7 countries where Google sells the Pixel, you will not be able to receive any support regardless of whether the device they sold you is faulty. The only offer the internet giant can offer: you take the risk of shipping damage, customs delay, and bear the cost of shipping both ways internationally to a friend, give them your gmail password (great security!) and have them process the replacement from your google account...or you could wait months without being able to place a call till you return to the USA.

No combination of buttons has been successful in a recovery process, and the phone isn't recognizable when plugging it into my PC. It does charge, though. Contacting Nokia support multiple times has always led me to the same response: ""we'll need it delivered."" The real kicker is that there aren't any Nokia Care Centers in my country, so Nokia won't accept my phone for repairs! Fortunately, I contacted Amazon regarding this issue and it has been settled. ---Check whether or not Nokia can fulfill their warranty on this phone before buying. In my case, they couldn't. ---Be wary of a phone that gets possibly hazardous updates from Google. This feels like one of those times where Android One backfired. Anyway, during those two months when the phone was still functional, there are a few things that are worth mentioning. 1) The actual build quality is superb. No screws anywhere in sight, the copper accent (on the Steel color option) is gorgeous as it reflects light. Glass back. Feels very premium. Slap a protective case on it asap because it's slippery. 2) The battery isn't very good. With minimal use, the phone would be down to 32% before going to bed. 3) The screen is very clear and very crisp. Not too bright during day time, but colors definitely pop when you're indoors. HDR display is real. 4) The camera is painfully average. So, it's an acceptable budget phone with certain compromises.

The charger that was included worked great. However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.

After researching online, I narrowed my choice to two phones (refurbs), the Samsung S7 or the Google Pixel. The Samsung S7 won out on price. The google pixel would have cost me considerably more for a used phone. It's difficult to beat a lightly used S7 for $230, free shipping and a 30 day warranty. I ordered this used S7 with a little trepidation. Would the phone be in good condition? Would there be any problems with the phone or difficulty transitioning? Would I like or love the S7? The remainder of this review addresses those questions. The phone was in very good condition. Minor if any use. My partner has an S7 a few years old, and this phone I ordered looked to be in better condition. There were no problems with the phone in terms of hardware. The phone was ready for setup. The transitioning was a little long winded and scary. The phone setup asks for my old google and Samsung account id's and passwords I may have used from my own phone. After fiddling around for while, I created a new Samsung account and figured out my old Google account. I also had to look up the email settings on my old phone to get the email set up correctly. After an hour or so, I was able to make calls, send messages and retrieve emails. This S7 obviously hadn't been used for a while, because it took several hours of updates to get the Android and Samsung software current. I decided to do these updates myself all at once, rather than schedule them at night. It took several hours to go through the downloads, installs and probably 7 or 8 restarts. I did this while I was updating my FB status on my PC :) The phone itself is great. It's fairly snappy and the screen quality (especially at the highest setting) really looks good. The ""always on"" is nice. The phone displays the date and time when not in use (I have a phone holder in my office so now it's my clock and calendar). Very nice camera on the phone. Takes pretty decent low light photos most the time, but some can be out of focus in very low light. Have to keep snapping until you get the one you want. In normal indoor or bright light the phone doesn't struggle at all. My only slight nitpick is the battery life isn't outstanding. If you want to get more than a day of battery life you have to choose a medium or lower screen resolution and energy saving options. This is definitely a phone you really need to leave in the charger at night. All in all, the S7 is the best deal on the planet for a used phone.",Verified,Neutral

Before I decided to buy this phone, numerous reviews and researches had been done. Then this phone became my final choice. This is a decent phone. There are quite a few concerns online over the battery, screen resolution, and the main camera's lack of optical image stabilizer. Well, I'd like to say that after having this phone for couple of days, the only thing I don't find entirely satisfying is the main camera. Although it comes with 21.5 mega pixels, the quality of the photos really isn't any better than the main camera on the LG G3, which has 13 mega pixels. The 1920x1080p screen is great, and sometime can be rather too bright, but such problem can be taken care of by dialing the brightness down several notches. Battery wise, when it's fully charged, two 120mins movies on Netflix, 20 plus photographs taken with flash, on and off web browsing, numerous text messages exchange on two messengers, all done in the time span of 7 hours, can be sustained by the battery with still 8% left. It also doesn't take more than two hours to fully charge the battery, despite some reviews online. I have noticed that it has taken about a minute to charge a little more than 1% of the power. From 3% to 100%, the battery on my phone took about 93 minutes. Another thing is that I have watched a review on You Tube about somebody claiming that this phone doesn't allow apps to be saved on the additional memory card. Well, I have no problem transfer most of my apps on to the SD card, so just for the reference. Anyway, for a mid-range phone at this price, it is not bad. Update on Decembter 29.2016: It's been a few weeks since I started using this phone, and I have noticed several problems. 1. The SD card reader often malfunctions for no apparent reason. I had to take the card out of the slot, and reinsert again in order to get the phone to read the card again. 2. Video recording always stops on its' own within seconds after being turned on (in 1080p mode). 3. Some Sony bloat wares can not be uninstalled, or even disabled. 4. Keyboards often retract during typing. I have been dedbating whether to return this phone.

The Galaxy Note 4 has features that are close to the Galaxy Note 8. The screen resolution, bluetooth version, removable battery are a good upgrade from my Galaxy S5. Like the noncurved flat screen since I place the phone into grip stand holders. No water resistance. Problem I have is with the Samsung brand batteries that ship with this phone even though the phone and Battery should have been recertified to work correctly. I've had to exchange this phone and each included a Samsung brand battery that caused the boot-looping. The Samsung battery would charge up to 100%, but when the charge is below 30%, bootlooping occurred and at different times even sooner. Therefore forcing me to pull the battery out from the phone to stop the reboots where I can recharge the battery. After weeks of troubleshooting and phoning Samsung tech support, the solution was to buy a ZeroLemon brand battery or any 3rd party battery and not the Samsung brand; as history has shown how faulty Samsung batteries can be. The batteries come with the built-in NFC antenna. So make sure you test the wireless NFC is working on the replacement battery for data transfers and also Yubi-Key tokens, if you use security tokens for Two-Factor Authentication. This phone would be better if it could use the latest Samsung software to do language translation like in the Galaxy 8 line. So I have to make do with Google Translate app. The phone over all works well and has a removable battery and infrared blaster. If you buy this phone, then make sure the first thing you do is to charge up the battery and press the three buttons to do a hardware reset in order to put the phone software back to factory default settings, because my phone had ""Welcome to AT&T"" email or text saved on phone when, in fact, I had a Verizon branded logo on the phone startup screen and Verizon removable back cover. I had ordered the Verizon CDMA variant to use with Net10 service on Verizon cell tower network coverage. Has Verizon bloatware apps. Then setup WiFi only, don't insert the micro SIM chip until after you can test battery and NFC and transfer data/apps from old phone to new phone using Samsung Smart Switch, latest version of Samsung Kies does not want to work with newer phone model like Note 4. The Kies backup program has its own quirks on how much data it will restore and transfer. Good luck with your phone. I knocked off two stars on the rating because of the difficulty I went through weeks to troubleshoot the phone and buy separate batteries. The basic phone itself is good and a lot cheaper than the latest thousand-dollar Galaxy 8 phones.",Verified,Neutral

Prior to purchasing this Nokia device, all four of my smartphones were Windows devices. My Lumia 950 suffered a premature death, so my best option was to move to Android or Apple since the entire Windows Phone platform also died. I've used Android tablets before, so I knew a little bit about what to expect with an Android device. This device has been a bit more glitchy than my Windows phones. I'm not sure if its because Android is more open and customizable, or if it relates specifically to the Nokia 6. Overall, this phone is a great value. It looks great and is built solidly. This was my draw over spending double or more for a Samsung device. It can be a bit sluggish while running multiple apps, but it's not too noticeable. I gave this phone a three-star rating based on two major drawbacks: the call quality is poor and choppy in cars, and the widgets keep disappearing. The widget issue was finally solved by enough system updates and/or using a new launcher application. But in the end, a phone's basic function is to place and receive calls, and if I can't use hands-free bluetooth without suffering poor call quality, then this phone leaves much to be desired.",Verified,Negative

I get an average of about 8.5 hrs of screen on time and even more if i take out one of the 2 sim cards. This phone also has great developer support on XDA, I Flashed a custom Kernel, Google GCam Port, and Magisk. and i have the phone exactly how i want it and i love how Xiaomi supports custom development and making available the mi flash tool and the source firmware to recover the phone if you mess up while tinkling with it. The only thing i dont like the micro USB port because i was spoiled by usb type-c in my nexus 5. However because the battery last so long i dont have to charge often and dont have to fiddle with the orientation as much.
